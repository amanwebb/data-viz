### So what the heck is data visualization?!?

Data visualization is extremely critical to a data scientist's job. Essentially, it is a way to make your analyses clearer and easier to understand. It is very beneficial for non-statisticians, for it helps them see what you see in the data. As the old adage states: A picture is worth a thousand words. A person with little to no knowledge in statistics or data analysis will not necessarily be able to understand your code, tests, or analyses; however, they might be able to understand a picture or a chart. Data visualization is important to be able to present your final results in a clear, concise, and compelling manner to your often non-technical audience. 

#### Some T-SQL Code

```tsql
SELECT This, [Is], A, Code, Block -- Using SSMS style syntax highlighting
    , REVERSE('abc')
FROM dbo.SomeTable s
    CROSS JOIN dbo.OtherTable o;
```

#### Some PowerShell Code

```powershell
Write-Host "This is a powershell Code block";

# There are many other languages you can use, but the style has to be loaded first

ForEach ($thing in $things) {
    Write-Output "It highlights it using the GitHub style"
}
```
